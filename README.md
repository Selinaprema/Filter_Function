# Filter Function

## Description
This project demonstrates the concept of **higher-order functions** by creating a custom implementation of the **filter()** method in JavaScript. Instead of using the built-in `filter()` method, we define our own function called `myFilterFunction()`.

## Features
- **Defines a higher-order function** `myFilterFunction()`, which:
  - Accepts an **array of words** as input.
  - Uses a **callback function** to check if a word has **six letters**.
  - Returns a **new array** containing only the words that meet the condition.
- **Demonstrates callback functions** by passing a function that checks word length.
- **Mimics the behavior of JavaScriptâ€™s built-in `filter()` method**.

## Files Included
- `higherOrder.js` - JavaScript file containing the implementation of `myFilterFunction()`.

## How to Use
1. Run `higherOrder.js` in a JavaScript environment.
2. Modify the word list to test different scenarios.
3. Observe how the custom filter function behaves similarly to the built-in `filter()`.
